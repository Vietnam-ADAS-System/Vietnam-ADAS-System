# Vietnam Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)

A comprehensive Advanced Driver Assistance System designed and implemented for Vietnamese roads.

## Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent system that combines:
- **Computer Vision** for real-time object and lane detection
- **Deep Learning** for robust vehicle, traffic sign, and lane segmentation
- **Real-time Processing** with object tracking
- **ADAS Logic** for intelligent warnings and alerts

## System Architecture

```

## Key Features

### 1. Vehicle Detection
- Real-time detection using YOLOv11
- Detects: Cars, Buses, Trucks, Motorcycles, Persons

### 2. Lane Detection & Segmentation
- DeepLabV3+ for semantic lane segmentation
- Traditional CV methods (Hough Transform, Edge Detection)
- Lane departure warnings

### 3. Traffic Sign Recognition
- YOLOv11-based traffic sign detection
- Recognizes: Stop signs, No Entry, Speed limits, Turn arrows

### 4. Object Tracking
- Unique ID assignment using DeepSORT
- Vehicle trajectory tracking

### 5. ADAS Warnings
- Lane departure alerts
- Traffic sign warnings
- Speed limit notifications

## Directory Structure

See [docs/cây thư mục.md](docs/cây%20thư%20mục.md) for detailed structure.

### Quick Overview
- `frontend/` - React.js UI application
- `backend/node-server/` - Express.js API server
- `backend/ai-service/` - Python FastAPI AI service
- `datasets/` - Training datasets
- `outputs/` - System outputs and results
- `docs/` - Documentation and reports
- `notebooks/` - Research and experiment notebooks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+ (for frontend and backend)
- Python 3.8+ (for AI service)
- CUDA 11.0+ (recommended for GPU acceleration)

### Installation

#### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

#### Backend - Node Server
```bash
cd backend/node-server
npm install
npm start
```

#### Backend - AI Service
```bash
cd backend/ai-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Project Workflow

1. **Frontend** captures or uploads video
2. **Node.js Server** handles API requests
3. **Python AI Service** processes video frames with:
   - Object detection
   - Lane segmentation
   - Traffic sign recognition
4. **System** fuses results and generates warnings
5. **Frontend** displays results and alerts to driver

## Performance Metrics

- **FPS**: Target 24+ FPS for real-time processing
- **Detection mAP50**: Target >80%
- **Segmentation mIoU**: Target >75%
- **Latency**: <100ms per frame

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React.js
- HTML5/CSS3
- Canvas for video rendering

### Backend
- Node.js + Express.js
- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI

### AI/ML
- YOLOv11 (Object Detection)
- DeepLabV3+ (Semantic Segmentation)
- OpenCV (Traditional Computer Vision)
- PyTorch (Deep Learning Framework)
- DeepSORT (Object Tracking)

## Evaluation

Model evaluation metrics are computed in:
- `backend/ai-service/evaluation/`

Results include:
- Detection: Precision, Recall, mAP50, mAP50-95
- Segmentation: IoU, mIoU, Pixel Accuracy
- System: FPS, Latency
